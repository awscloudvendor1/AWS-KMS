what is kms 
aws key management service (aws kms ) is a managed service - here managed service means kms is managed by aws, not by us like kms key update, policy update, kms backup
kms key provides the next level of security to our data by providing encryption to data
kms key helps us to manage our data securely and also reduce the burden of managing user access with IAM policy or s3 bucket policy 
In simple words, key management services or kms help us to encrypt and decrypt the data 


types of kms 
we have 2 types of kms key provided by aws 

symmetric - a single encryption key used for both encrypt and decrypt the data 
asymmetric - a public and private key pair that can be used to encrypt/decrypt the data. 

create 2 IAM users with s3 full permission 
login to aws console 
go to service and in the search tab look for IAM 
from the dashboard select user - select programmatic access
create 2 users and give both s3 full permission 
make sure to download the access key and secret key and store it in a secure location 

how to create kms key 
login to aws console - select the region 
go to service and in the search tab look for kms 
in kms on the left side 3 options are there -
aws managed keys
customer-managed keys 
customer key store
select the customer-managed keys
in this demo will use symmetric key - select symmetric
in the advance key section select the kms 
regionality leave default 
in the next windows 3 options to fill 
alias - recommended giving some alias name 
description - recommended giving some description ( optional field ) 
Tags - recommended giving some tags name ( optional field ) 
in the next screen select the key administrator - here need to give the user/group/role who administer access to this policy 

The next tab is for key deletion (optional field ) 
next need to select key permissions - here need to select users for whom kms access require 

verify the key policy

    ]

create s3 bucket 

login to aws console - select the region 
go to service and in the search tab look for s3
in the left panel - select s3 bucket - create a bucket 
give a unique name to your bucket and select the same region in which aws kms key is created 
leave all the settings as it and click on create a bucket 


configure both users with aws-cli
aws configure --profile user1
aws configure --profile user2

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=

next step - put some files inside the s3 bucket and verify both user access to it 

aws s3 ls

aws s3 cp s3://enteryourbucketnamehere/filename . --profile user1  

aws s3 cp s3://enteryourbucketnamehere/filename . --profile user2 



Till this point both users were able to download, list file without error 


how to enable encryption on s3 bucket

login to aws console - select the region 
go to service and in the search tab look for s3
select the bucket on which you need to enable encryption 
select properties - scroll down and select default encryption - enable it 


verify both users access again 

aws s3 cp s3://enteryourbucketnamehere/filename . --profile user1  

aws s3 cp s3://enteryourbucketnamehere/filename . --profile user2 



Now here only users with kms key access are able to call the s3 bucket operation
